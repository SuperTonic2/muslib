This article, written by Indiana University Bloomington's Head of Music Library Technical Services and Music Librarianship Program advisor Keith Cochran, provides an in-depth look at the degree requirements for students pursuing Music Librarianship at Indiana University Bloomington. Cochran discusses the two forms that the Music Librarianship Program takes at Indiana University Bloomington: a Master of Library Science (MLS) degree with a specialization in Music Librarianship, and a dual master's program in which students can earn an MLS (typically with the Music Librarianship specialization) and a Master of Arts (MA) in Music concurrently.

It covers the early genesis of the music library in the early 20th century, the creation of a formal music library space in Merrill Hall in the late 1930s, the relocation of ensemble materials to Sycamore Hall in the 1970s, and the building of the Bess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center at the turn of the 21st century, which houses the William & Gayle Cook Music Library today.
