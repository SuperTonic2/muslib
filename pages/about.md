## About this Collection

This digital collection contains documents and photographs from multiple campus repositories at Indiana University Bloomington that tell the story of how music librarianship has evolved on the University's campus. It includes materials related to the career Ethel Louise Lyman, the University's first Music Librarian; subsequent music librarians who helped build the University's music collections throughout the 20th century; the buildings and spaces that housed those music collections; and the genesis of the Music Librarianship Dual Degree and Specialization programs in the late 1970's.

It is important to note that this collection is limited in focus to the main Indiana University Bloomington Music Library (known today as the [William and Gayle Cook Music Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/cook-music-library)), its music librarians, and the programs that have existed to train student music librarians. However, Indiana University Bloomington contains a multitude of other music repositories and repositories with music collections that are not extensively explored in this resource in its current form. These include:

* [The Archives of African American Music and Culture](https://aaamc.indiana.edu/)
* [The Archives of Traditional Music](https://libraries.indiana.edu/archives-traditional-music)
* [The Lilly Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/lilly-library)
* [The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology](https://iumaa.iu.edu/index.html)

This article, written by current Music Librarianship advisor Keitch Cochran, provides an in-depth look at the degree requirements for students pursuing Music Librarianship at Indiana University Bloomington. Cochran discusses the two forms that the Music Librarianship Program takes at Indiana University Bloomington: a Master of Library Science (MLS) degree with a specialization in Music Librarianship, and a dual master's program in which students can earn an MLS (typically with the Music Librarianship specialization) and a Master of Arts (MA) in Music concurrently.

This article, written by former Cook Music Library Director Mary Wallace Davidson, details the history of the William & Gayle Cook Music Library, the main music library at Indiana University Bloomington. It covers the early genesis of the music library in the early 20th century, the creation of a formal music library space in Merrill Hall in the late 1930s, the relocation of ensemble materials to Sycamore Hall in the 1970s, and the building of the Bess Meshulam Simon Music Library and Recital Center at the turn of the 21st century, which houses the William & Gayle Cook Music Library today.
