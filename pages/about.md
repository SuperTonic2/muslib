It is important to note that, at this time, this collection is limited in focus to the main Indiana University Bloomington Music Library (known today as the [William and Gayle Cook Music Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/cook-music-library)), its music librarians, its previous and current locations, and the programs that have existed to train student music librarians. However, Indiana University Bloomington contains a multitude of other music repositories and repositories with exceptional music collections that are not extensively explored in this resource in its current form. These include:

* [The Archives of African American Music and Culture](https://aaamc.indiana.edu/)
* [The Archives of Traditional Music](https://libraries.indiana.edu/archives-traditional-music)
* [The Lilly Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/lilly-library)
* [The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology](https://iumaa.iu.edu/index.html)

## Acknowledgements

This collection was created as part of the course Z652 Digital Libraries taught by Professor John Walsh and Associate Instructor Gyuri Kang. It's existence would not have been possible without their excellent instruction and guidance. 

The creation of this collection would have not been possible without the existence of multiple Indiana University campus repositories and the assistance of the archivists and librarians at those repositories.

The vast majority of the items in this repository come from the Indiana University Archives and the Archives Photograph Collection. The University Archives staff have been an extraordinary help throughout the creation of this project, especially Outreach and Public Services Archivist Carrie Schwier and Photograph Curator Bradley Cook.
