It is important to note that, at this time, this collection is limited in focus to the main Indiana University Bloomington Music Library (known today as the [William and Gayle Cook Music Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/cook-music-library)), its music librarians, its previous and current locations, and the programs that have existed to train student music librarians. However, Indiana University Bloomington contains a multitude of other music repositories and repositories with exceptional music collections that are not extensively explored in this resource in its current form. These include:

* [The Archives of African American Music and Culture](https://aaamc.indiana.edu/)
* [The Archives of Traditional Music](https://libraries.indiana.edu/archives-traditional-music)
* [The Lilly Library](https://libraries.indiana.edu/lilly-library)
* [The Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology](https://iumaa.iu.edu/index.html)

This article, written by current Music Librarianship advisor Keitch Cochran, provides an in-depth look at the degree requirements for students pursuing Music Librarianship at Indiana University Bloomington. Cochran discusses the two forms that the Music Librarianship Program takes at Indiana University Bloomington: a Master of Library Science (MLS) degree with a specialization in Music Librarianship, and a dual master's program in which students can earn an MLS (typically with the Music Librarianship specialization) and a Master of Arts (MA) in Music concurrently.
